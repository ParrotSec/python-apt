What's New In python-apt 1.7
============================

Changed
--------
* Starting with 1.6.1 and 1.7~alpha1, the exception raised when
  passing objects of a different cache to :class:`apt_pkg.DepCache`
  is :class:`apt_pkg.CacheMismatchError`, and :class:`apt.cache.Cache` will
  automatically remap open packages and versions to a new cache.

Added
------
* The class :class:`apt_pkg.PackageRecords` can now lookup custom fields
  using ``records[key]`` and ``key in records``.


* All code is now statically typed. Some methods from :mod:`apt_pkg`
  and :mod:`apt_inst` might still be missing or more strict than
  necessary.

* A new method :meth:`apt.cache.Cache.fix_broken` has been added.
